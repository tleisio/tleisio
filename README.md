Been in the Design/UX industry for a decade, knowing all along I'd like to address climate (and more).

My journey has led me to specialize more in information architecture. In short, I like to organize chaotic information environments and help teams establish aligned goals and next steps. I do this with research, collaborative activities, conversations, etc., as needed. I'm part of the HmntyCntrd, Earth-regenerators, and Climate designers mighty network, in addition to being a member of the Design justice network. All of this I participate in so that I might figure out how to transition myself to help establish just, regenerative systems.

Feel free to [reach out on twitter](https://twitter.com/timleisio) if you need design or UX consultation, or have a project of interest.

Thanks for the read!
